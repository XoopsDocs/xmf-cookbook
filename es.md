# README

A placeholder for a local language.

Copy files from the default language folder \(e.g. /en\) here, and then translate them.

Also make sure that your language is added the the selection in "LANGS.md" file. For example, for Spanish, we should add

`* [Español](es)`

so it looks like this:

`* [English](en)`  
 `* [Español](es)`
