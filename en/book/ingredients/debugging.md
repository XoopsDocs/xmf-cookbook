## Debugging

When you are coding, things happen. When code goes live, things happen. Sometime, when those things happen
it isn't practical, or in some cases even possible, to use XDebug in a fancy IDE. The old fashioned, light
weight approach of echoing variable from deep inside the code comes to the rescue. But, echo and var_export
have are not the most friendly or productive tools. This is where `Xmf\Debug` is your friend.
